#VARIABLE ASSIGNMENT

#A basic concept in (statistical) programming is called a variable.
#A variable allows you to store a value (e.g. 4) or an object (e.g. a function description) in R. You can then later use this variable's name to easily access the value or the object that is stored within this variable.
#You can assign a value 4 to a variable my_variable with the command

#Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42
# Print out the value of the variable x
x

# Assign a value to the variables called my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6
# Add these two variables together and print the result
my_apples + my_oranges
# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- (my_apples + my_oranges)

##########################
# Basic data types in R

#R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:
#Decimals values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Natural numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical (TRUE can be abbreviated to T and FALSE to F).
#Text (or string) values are called characters.

# What's the answer to the universe
my_numeric <- 42

# The quotation marks indicate that the variable is of type character
my_character <- c('forty-two')

my_logical <- FALSE

# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "forty-two"
my_logical <- FALSE

#Do you remember that when you added 5 + "six", you got an error due to a mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this as follows:

# Assign the data type
datatype1 <- class(my_numeric)
datatype2 <- class(my_character)
datatype3 <- class(my_logical)

# Print the types
datatype1
datatype2
datatype3

# Create a vector

#On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.
#In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the brackets. For example:

numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
boolean_vector <- c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
# Print the vectors
numeric_vector
character_vector
boolean_vector

# lets us assigne  some more vectors

# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140,-50,20,-120,240)

# Roulette winnings form Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24,-50,100,-350,10)


#As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.
#In the previous exercise, we created a vector with your winnings over the week. Each vector element refers to a day of the week but it is hard to tell which element belongs to which day. It would be nice if you could show that in the vector itself.
#You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. Have a look at this example:

some_vector <- c("Johnny", "Poker Player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")

# Create the variable days_vector
days_vector <- c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday')
# Assign the names of the day to the roulette and poker_vectors
names(poker_vector) <- days_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- days_vector

# Print the named vectors to the console
poker_vector
roulette_vector

#  arithmetic calculations on vectors.

#It is important to know is that if you sum two vectors in R, it takes the element-wise sum. For example, the following three statements are completely equivalent:
> c(1, 2, 3) + c(4, 5, 6)
#[1] 5 7 9
> c(1 + 4, 2 + 5, 3 + 6)
#[1] 5 7 9
> c(5, 7, 9)
#[1] 5 7 9

A_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
B_vector <- c(4, 5, 6)

# Take the sum of A_vector and B_vector
total_vector <-c(1, 2, 3)+c(4, 5, 6)
# Show me:
total_vector

 # Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)
# Roulette winnings form Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Name poker and roulette
days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
names(roulette_vector) <- days
names(poker_vector) <- days

total_poker <- sum(poker_vector)

# Up to you now: assign the correct values to:
total_roulette <- sum(roulette_vector)
total_week <-sum(total_roulette+total_poker)

# Show me:
total_week

# Check if you realized higher total gains in poker then in roulette
answer <- total_poker<total_roulette
# Show me the

# to select specifc number in a vecotr you can use brackets [] i.e. vector[1] will give you the first number in the vector.
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_monday <- poker_vector[1]

#o select multiple elements from a vector, you can add square brackets at the end of it. You can indicate between the brackets what elements should be selected. For example: suppose you want to select the first and the fifth day of the week: use the vector c(1,5) between the square brackets. For example, the code below selects the first and fifth element of poker_vector:
# Define a new variable based on a selection
poker_midweek <- poker_vector[c(1,5)]

#Selecting multiple elements of poker_vector with c(2,3,4) is not very convenient. Many statisticians are lazy people by nature, so they created an easier way to do this: c(2,3,4) can be abbreviated to2:4, which generates a vector with all natural numbers from 2 up to 4.
#So, another way to find the mid-week results is poker_vector[2:4]. Notice how the vector 2:4 is placed between the square brackets to select element 2 up to 4.

# this means that :
roulette_selection_vector <- roulette_vector[2:4]
#is the same as :
roulette_selection_vector_1 <- roulette_vector[c(2,3,4)]

#Another way to tackle the previous exercise is by using the names of the vector elements (Monday, Tuesday, â€¦) instead of their numeric positions. For example,
poker_vector["Monday"]
#will select the first element of poker_vector since "Monday" is the name of that first element.
#Just like you did in the previous exercise with numerics, you can also use the element names to select multiple elements, for example:
poker_vector[c("Monday","Tuesday")]

#Calculate your average poker gains during the first three days of the week by selecting these elements with the help of the names. Assign this value to average_midweek_gain. You can use the mean() function to get the average of a vector.
average_midweek_gain <- mean(poker_vector[1:3])

#By making use of comparison operators, we can approach the previous question in a more pro-active way.
#The (logical) comparison operators known to R are:
  #< for less than
  #> for greater than
  #>= for greater than or equal to
  #== for equal to each other
  #!= not equal to each other
#As seen in the previous chapter, stating 6 > 5 returns TRUE. The nice thing about R is that you can use these comparison operators also on vectors. For example, the statement c(4,5,6) > 5 returns: FALSE FALSE TRUE. In other words, you test for every element of the vector if the condition stated by the comparison operator is TRUE or FALSE. Do not take our word for it! Try it in the console ;-).
#Behind the scenes, R recycles the value 5 when you execute c(4,5,6) > 5. R wants to do an element-wise comparison of each element in c(4,5,6) with each corresponding element in 5. However, 5 is not a vector of length three. To solve this, R automatically replicates the value 5 to generate a vector of three elements, c(5, 5, 5) and then carries out the element-wise comparison.

# What days of the week did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0

#  Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday 
#     TRUE     FALSE      TRUE     FALSE      TRUE


#Working with comparisons will make your data analytical life easier. Instead of selecting a subset of days to investigate yourself (like before), you can simply ask R to return only those days where you realized a positive return for poker.
#In the previous exercises you used selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0 to find the days on which you had a positive poker return. Now, you would like to know not only the days on which you won, but also how much you won on those days.
#You can select the desired elements, by putting selection_vector between the square brackets that follow poker_vector. This works, because R only selects those elements where selection_vector is TRUE by default. For selection_vector this means where poker_vector > 0.

# What days of the week did you make money on poker?
selection_vector <- poker_vector > 0
selection_vector
#   Monday   Tuesday Wednesday  Thursday    Friday 
#     TRUE     FALSE      TRUE     FALSE      TRUE 
# Select from poker_vector these days

# matrix

#In R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type (numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional.
#You can construct a matrix in R with the matrix() function. Consider the following example:
matrix(1:9, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)

with the matrix function. The data elements must be of the same basic type.

> A = matrix(

#Similarly, the entire nth column A can be extracted as A[ ,n].

A[ ,3]       # the 3rd column 
#[1] 3 7

#  The argument byrow indicates that the matrix is filled by the rows. If we want the vector to be filled by the columns, we just place byrow = FALSE.

# Total revenue for US and non-US
total_revenue_vector <- colSums(all_wars_matrix)


#Similar to vectors, you can use the square brackets [ ] to select one or multiple elements from a matrix. Whereas vectors have one dimension, matrices have two dimensions. You should therefore use a comma to separate that what to select from the rows from that what you want to select from the columns. For example:
my_matrix[1,2] #selects from the first row the second element.
my_matrix[1:3,2:4] #selects rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4.

#If you want to select all elements of a row or a column, no number is needed before or after the comma, respectively:
my_matrix[,1] #selects all elements of the first column.
my_matrix[1,] #selects all elements of the first row.

# Average non-US revenue per movie
non_us_all  <-  mean(star_wars_matrix[,2]) #2nd column all rows which is non-us revenue for all movies
non_us_all 
non_us_all_1  <-  mean(star_wars_matrix[,"non-US"]) #non-us revenue for all movies
non_us_all_1 
# Average non-US revenue of first two movies
non_us_some <- mean(star_wars_matrix[1:2,2])  #2nd column all rows (non-US) and first tow movies (rows)


#Similar to what you have learned with vectors, the standard operators like +, -, /, *, etc. work in an element-wise way on matrices in R.
#For example: 2 * my_matrix multiplies each element of my_matrix by two. Again, R recycles the value 2 behind the scenes, building a matrix containing only 2s with the same dimensions as my_matrix. Then, R carries out the element-wise operation.
#xAs a newly-hired data analyst for Lucasfilm, it is your job is to find out how many visitors went to each movie for each geographical area.

#  FACTORS

#The term factor refers to a statistical data type used to store categorical variables. The difference between a categorical variable and a continuous variable is that a categorical variable can belong to a limited number of categories. A continuous variable, on the other hand, can correspond to an infinite number of values.
#It is important that R knows whether it is dealing with a continuous or a categorical variable, as the statistical models you will develop in the future treat both types differently. (You will see later why this is the case.)
#A good example of a categorical variable is the variable 'Gender'. A human individual can either be "Male" or "Female", making abstraction of intersexes. So here "Male" and "Female" are, in a simplified sense, the two values of the categorical variable "Gender", and every observation can be assigned to either the value "Male" of "Female".


#To create factors in R, you make use of the function factor(). First thing that you have to do is create a vector that contains all the observations that belong to a limited number of categories. For example, gender_vector contains the sex of 5 different individuals:
gender_vector <- c("Male","Female","Female","Male","Male")

#It is clear that there are two categories, or in R-terms 'factor levels', at work here: "Male" and "Female".
#The function factor() will encode the vector as a factor:
factor_gender_vector <- factor(gender_vector)
factor_gender_vector

#There are two types of categorical variables: a nominal categorical variable and an ordinal categorical variable.

#A nominal variable is a categorical variable without an implied order. This means that it is impossible to say that 'one is worth more than the other'. For example, think of the categorical variable animals_vector with the categories "Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey" and "Horse". Here, it is impossible to say that one stands above or below the other. (Note that some of you might disagree ;-) ).
animals_vector <- c("Elephant", "Giraffe", "Donkey", "Horse")
factor_animals_vector <- factor(animals_vector)
factor_animals_vector

#In contrast, ordinal variables do have a natural ordering. Consider for example the categorical variable temperature_vector with the categories: "Low", "Medium" and "High". Here it is obvious that "Medium" stands above "Low", and "High" stands above "Medium".
temperature_vector <- c("High", "Low", "High","Low", "Medium")
factor_temperature_vector <- factor(temperature_vector, order = TRUE, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
factor_temperature_vector

#When you first get a data set, you will often notice that it contains factors with specific factor levels. However, sometimes you will want to change the names of these levels for clarity or other reasons. R allows you to do this with the function levels():
levels(factor_vector) <- c("name1","name2",...)

#A good illustration is the raw data that is provided to you by a survey. A standard question for every questionnaire is the gender of the respondent. You remember from the previous question that this is a factor and when performing the questionnaire on the streets its levels are often coded as "M" and "F".
survey_vector <- c("M","F","F","M","M")

#Next, when you want to start your data analysis, your main concern is to keep a nice overview of all the variables and what they mean. At that point, you will often want to change the factor levels to "Male" and "Female" instead of "M" and "F" to make your life easier.

survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")

# Encode survey_vector as a factor
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)

# Specify the levels of 'factor_survey_vector'
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Male","Female")

# Encode survey_vector as a factor
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)

factor_survey_vector
# your favourite functions in R will be summary(). This will give you a quick overview of some_variable:

#Going back to our survey, you would like to know how many "Male" responses you have in your study, and how many "Female" responses. The summary() function gives you the answer to this question.
survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")
factor_survey_vector

# Type your code here for 'survey_vector'
summary(survey_vector)

#   Length     Class      Mode 
#    5 character character 

# Type your code here for 'factor_survey_vector'
summary(factor_survey_vector)
# Female   Male 
#     2      3 

#In factor_survey_vector we have a factor with two levels: Male and Female. But how does R value these relatively to each other? In other words, who does R think is better, males or females?

survey_vector <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "M")
factor_survey_vector <- factor(survey_vector)
levels(factor_survey_vector) <- c("Female", "Male")

# Male
factor_survey_vector[1] 
# Female
factor_survey_vector[2] 
# Battle of the sexes: Male 'larger' than female?
factor_survey_vector[1] > factor_survey_vector[2] 


#Since "Male" and "Female" are unordered (or nominal) factor levels, R returns a warning message, telling you that the greater than operator is not meaningful. As seen before, R attaches an equal value to the levels for such factors.
#But this is not always the case! Sometimes you will also deal with factors that do have a natural ordering between its categories. If this is the case, we have to make sure that we pass this information to Râ€¦
#Let us say that you are leading a research team of five data analysts and that you want to evaluate their performance. To do this, you track their speed, evaluate each analyst as "Slow", "Fast" or "Ultra-fast", and save the results in speed_vector.


#speed_vector should be converted to an ordinal factor since its categories have a natural ordening. By default, the function factor() transforms speed_vector into an unordered factor. To create an ordered factor, you have to add two additional arguments: ordered and levels.

factor(some_vector, ordered = TRUE, levels = c("Level_1", "Level_2" ...))

speed_vector <- c("Fast", "Slow", "Slow", "Fast", "Ultra-fast") 

# Add your code below
factor_speed_vector <-  factor(speed_vector, ordered=TRUE, levels = c("Slow","Fast","Ultra-fast"))

# Print
factor_speed_vector

# R prints automagically in the right order

# DATA FRAMS

#You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your data set on Star Wars only contained numeric elements.
#When doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:
#'Are your married?' or 'yes/no' questions (= boolean data type)
#'How old are you?' (= numeric data type)
#'What is your opinion on this product?' or other 'open-ended' questions (= character data type)
#The output, namely the respondents' answers to the questions formulated above, is a data set of different data types. You will often find yourself working with data sets that contain different data types instead of only one.
#A data frame has the variables of a data set as columns and the observations as rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.

#the function head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame (or any R object you pass to it). Unoriginally, the function tail() prints out the last observations in your data set
head(mtcars)

#Another method that is often used to get a rapid overview of your data is the function str(). The function str() shows you the structure of your data set. For a data frame it tells you:
#The total number of observations (e.g. 32 car types)
#The total number of variables (e.g. 11 car features)
#A full list of the variables names (e.g. mpg, cyl â€¦ )
#The data type of each variable (e.g. num for car features)
#The first observations
#Applying the str() function will often be the first thing that you do when receiving a new data set or data frame. It is a great way to get more insight in your data set before diving into the real analysis.

planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune");
type <- c("Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Terrestrial planet", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant", "Gas giant")
diameter <- c(0.382, 0.949, 1, 0.532, 11.209, 9.449, 4.007, 3.883); 
rotation <- c(58.64, -243.02, 1, 1.03, 0.41, 0.43, -0.72, 0.67);
rings <- c(FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE);

# Create the data frame:
planets_df  <-data.frame(planets,type,diameter,rotation,rings)

#Similar to vectors and matrices, you select elements from a data frame with the help of square brackets [ ]. By using a comma, you can indicate what to select from the rows and the columns respectively. For example:
my_data_frame[1,2] #selects from the first row in my_data_frame the second element.
my_data_frame[1:3,2:4] #selects rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4 in my_data_frame.
#Sometimes you want to select all elements of a row or column. To do this, you can use the follwing. my_data_frame[1, ] selects all elements of the first row. Let us now apply this technique on planets_df!

# The 'planets_df' data frame from the previous exercise is pre-loaded
planets_df[1,2] #selects from the first row in my_data_frame the second element.
planets_df[1:3,2:4] #selects rows 1,2,3 and columns 2,3,4 in my_data_frame.

head(planets_df)
planets_df
# All data from the first three planets
closest_planets_df <- planets_df[1:3,]

# All data from the last three planets
furthest_planets_df <- planets_df[6:8,]

# Have a look:
closest_planets_df
furthest_planets_df

#Select for the last six rows only the diameter and assign this selection to furthest_planets_diameter.
# Do selection on both rows and columns
furthest_planets_diameter <- planets_df[3:8,"diameter"]

#You will often want to select an entire column, namely one specific variable from a data frame. If you want to select all elements of the variable rings, both planets_df[,5] and planets_df[,"rings"] do the trick.
#However, there is a short-cut. Use the $-sign to tell R that it only has to look up all the elements of the variable behind the sign:

data_frame_name$variable_name


#Make use of the $-sign to create the variable rings_vector that contains all elements of the rings variable in the planets_df data frame.

# Create the rings_vector
rings_vector <- planets_df$rings


# Select the information on planets with rings:
planets_with_rings_df <- planets_df[rings_vector==TRUE,]

planets_with_rings_df <- planets_df[planets_df$rings==TRUE,]

#So what exactly did you learn in the previous exercises? You selected a subset from a data frame (planets_df) based on whether or not a certain condition was true (rings or no rings), and you managed to pull out all relevant data. Pretty awesome! By now, NASA is probably already flirting with your CV ;-).
#Now, let us move up one level and use the function subset(). You should see the subset() function as a short-cut to do exactly the same as what you did in the previous exercises.
subset(my_data_frame, subset = some_condition)

#The first argument of subset() specifies the data set for which you want a subset. By adding the second argument, you give R the necessary information and conditions to select the correct subset.
#For example:
subset(planets_df, subset = rings == TRUE)
#R will give you exactly the same result as you got in the previous exercise. But this time without needing the rings_vector!

# 'planets_df' is pre-loaded in your workspace
# Planets that are smaller than planet Earth:
small_planets_df  <- subset(planets_df, subset = diameter<1)

# SORTING

# Making and creating rankings is one of mankind's favorite affairs. 
# These rankings can be useful (best universities in the world), entertaining (most influencial moviestars) or pointless (best 007 look-a-like). 
# Up to you for which purpose you want to use your R skills ;-).
# In data analysis you will sort your data according to a certain variable in the data set.
# In R, this is done with the help of the function order().
# order() is a function that gives you the ranked position of each element when it is applied on a variable, such as a vector for example. Let us look at the vector a: a <- c(100,9,101)

# What is the correct ordering based on the planets_df$diameter variable?
positions <- order(planets_df$diameter, decreasing = TRUE)

# Create new "ordered" data frame:
largest_first_df <- planets_df[positions,]

#Vectors (one dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in one vector all have the same datatype.
#Matrices (two dimensional array): can hold numeric, character or logical values. The elements in one matrix all have the same datatype.
#Data frames (two-dimensional objects): can hold numeric, character or logical values. Within a column all elements have the same data type, but different columns can be of different data type.

## LISTS

#A list in R is similar to your to-do list at work or school: the different items on that list most likely differ in length, characteristic, type of activity that has to do be done, â€¦
#A list in R allows you to gather a variety of objects under one name (that is, the name of the list) in an ordered way. These objects can be matrices, vectors, data frames, even other lists, etc. It is not even required that these objects are related to each other. Just like your to-do list :-).
#Maybe you can even say that a list is a kind of super data type ;-)
