# R_tutorial
A basic tutorial of R (i.e. reference library)

A group of notes & R scripts focused on Statistical Learning and the science of Data Exploration

Notes are based based on Gareth James • Daniela Witten • Trevor Hastie Robert Tibshirani book An Introduction to Statistical Learning.

these notes are copied to my repository for easy access and reference as I build my library of Statistical Learning methods.
